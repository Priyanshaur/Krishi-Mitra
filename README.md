<br />

Krishi Mitra is a farmer-first, full-stack digital ecosystem that fuses AI-powered crop diagnostics, a compliant B2B agri-marketplace, and precision farm management into one seamless platform. By combining multilingual conversational interfaces with a continuously improving data backbone, the solution helps Indian farmers raise yields, secure better prices, and build resilience against climate and market shocks.

## 🌾 Why Krishi Mitra

- **Edge-ready diagnostics:** Lightweight CNN models (EdgePlantNet/MobileNet class) deliver fast, offline-friendly disease detection tailored to Indian agro-climatic conditions.
- **Proprietary data engine:** Farmer image uploads, agronomist validation, and feedback loops fuel a self-improving dataset that augments public corpora such as PlantVillage.
- **Farmer-centric UX:** Voice and text experiences leverage Indic ASR/TTS (e.g., Bhashini) so every farmer—regardless of literacy or dialect—receives actionable guidance.
- **Transparent trade rails:** The marketplace compresses price discovery and payouts, trimming legacy mandi inefficiencies while staying aligned with APMC/APLM norms and e-NAM integrations.
- **Precision advisories:** Hyperlocal weather (Bharat Forecast System), soil health cards, and field telemetry feed AI insights that connect diagnostics directly to interventions, procurement, and certification.

## ⚙️ Core Capabilities

### 1. AI Crop Diagnostics
- Edge-ready CNNs enable low-latency inference on rural smartphones, with cloud escalation for complex cases.
- Dataset strategy: bootstrap with public sets, expand with farmer uploads, expert audits, and seasonal feedback.
- Conversational assistant supports image capture guidance, diagnosis explanations, and remedy walkthroughs in multiple languages and voice modes.

### 2. B2B Agri-Marketplace
- Digitally disrupts mandi middle layers by linking farmers to institutional buyers with transparent pricing, escrowed payments, and digital quality certificates.
- Hybrid operating model blends DeHaat-like farmer stickiness (extension services, advisory) with Agrim-like asset-light logistics via partner networks.
- Compliance baked in: state-specific APMC licenses, APLM Act guardrails, and e-NAM interoperability ensure legality and scale.

### 3. Smart Farm Management Suite
- Hyperlocal advisories derived from Bharat Forecast System feeds, on-field IoT nodes, and Soil Health Card data.
- Integrated workflow: diagnostics → advisory → marketplace transaction → certification → financing.
- Gov-tech partnerships (PM-KISAN, KCC onboarding) accelerate trust, data quality, and farmer acquisition.

### 4. Data Flywheel
- Every interaction (images, agronomist corrections, marketplace orders, logistics milestones) enriches a knowledge graph.
- The flywheel sharpens model accuracy, demand forecasting, input recommendations, and credit risk assessment over time.
